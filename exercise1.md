For Python, there are plenty of different linting tools. Popular approach is to use combo linters, which combine several individual tools into one package. Common choices for these are Flake8 and Pylama, which include these individual tools among others: PyFlakes, pycodestyle (formerly pep8) and Mccabe. For testing, Python has a PyUnit testing framework built directly to it for unit testing. For system testing and integration, the Testify framework is a good option. Other options are e.g. Lettuce, Doctest and Pytest. For building Python, options are e.g. PyBuilder, Poetry and SCons. For CI, Travis CI is a very popular choice. Travis offers an enterprise version which supports both self-hosted and cloud-based setups. Enterprise version is targeted to large companies which require professional features such as high performance and high configurational level. Travis also scales down to the small projects offering cost efficient options. Travis supports integration to most common cloud environments. In most cases a cloud based environment is a good choice. It offers relatively good performance, scales according to your needs and billing is based on the actual usage. Self-hosted options should be considered only when the speed of deployment process is critical and when there are resources to set up and maintain the self-hosted environment or if there are security reasons which restrict to a self-hosted environment.
